Using an AWS tutorial, I successfully built my first web application that utilizes AWS Amplify to take in an email/password input, call an API and an AWS Lambda function to send a MFA code, then display the user's email. This simple, yet insightful, app reminded me of the processes I used at Amazon last summer. I learned new coding techniques in the AWS CLI and the React framework.
